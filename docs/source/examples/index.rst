Welcome in the examples section of our docs.
The examples aim to show you how some of the features of this extension can be used and implemented.
The examples can be used as alongside the quickstart guide as way to learn to use the extension.

These examples are also available on our `GitHub repository <github.com/DisnakeCommunity/disnake-ext-components/blob/rewrite/>`_ and are perfectly runnable as-is.
The easiest way of running the examples is:

1. Clone the repository,
2. Run ``poetry install`` to install dependencies,
3. Copy ``.env.example`` and name it ``.env``,
4. Enter your bot token in the new ``.env`` file,
5. Run ``poetry run example <name>``.

Welcome in the examples section of our docs. Our examples aim on showing
to you how some of the features of this extension can be used and implemented. The examples
can also be used as a quickstart guide, a way to learn to use the extension.

These examples are also available on our GitHub repository (`disnake-ext-components`_) and are perfectly runnable as-is (provided that the token in entered and valid).
You can easily run the examples by cloning the GitHub repository and by creating (and loading) a `.env` file where you'll put your discord bot token following the `.env.example <https://github.com/DisnakeCommunity/disnake-ext-components/blob/rewrite/.env.example/>`_ format.

If you wants more examples or simply wants to add new ones every issue/pull request is welcome.
